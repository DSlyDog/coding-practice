    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's ya check."

10. Storyboard

    Section 1: Opening

    Centuries ago there was a great war. In the desert just outside the city of Sandstone the final showdown occurred.

A blue dragonborn named Famoria, and his dragon army, defeated the Arconaloth Xalto. The magic book he wielded, The Book

of Vile Darkness, was lost after the battle, buried in a tomb beneath the bones of an ancient dragon.

    Well, that's what this plaque says on the wall at least... Every time you visit this tavern, Dimdan's Tavern O' the

Fallen, you find yourself gazing at the plaque while you drink the heavily spiked ale. Everyone that's gone searching for

the book has never returned, and you wonder as you admire your weapons set and equipment whether or not you should attempt

it.

    The bartender approaches you while drying a few glasses. "Ya seem quite interested in that there plaque. You another

one of them brash explorers?"



    Part 1A

    If yes: "Indeed. It's been my trade for twenty-five years now."

    "Heh, yer dressed as one anyway. So, why ya so interested in the plaque? Ya wanna find the book?"

    "What? You know something about it?"



    If no: "No...but I aspire to be one."

    "Well, if ya plan on searchin' for that book as your first expedition you'd best be turnin' back now. That tomb'll eat

you up."

    "If you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how to stay safe?"



    Section 2: Fight or Flight

    "Maybe, but my memory is foggy. Perhaps some gold will help clear it up." He grins and holds out his hand.

    You put your hand on your coin pouch knowing you only have twenty gold coins.



    Part 2A

    Will you try to intimidate him? (yes or no)

    If yes: You stand up, towering over him, and pull out one of your sharp shortswords. In a single, swift movement, you

cut off the top half of the glass in his hand and point the sword at his neck. "Tell me what I want to know," you bellow.



        Part 2A-A

   (Randomizer unknown to user. If number is 11-20, intimidation successful. If 2-10 not successful and player will be

asked to pay. If 1, it will be game over.)

        If success: "Alright! Alright, I'll tell ya. No need ta cut me in half."

            "Out with it then!" you shout in his face.

            "Calm down will ya. Jus' enter through the dragon's maw. There's a labyrinth from there. Be

    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's ya check."

        The charge was ten gold which you quickly pay before hurrying off.



        If fail: The bartender smiles and glances toward a massive man nearby that has a huge mace strapped to his belt. "I

    would advise against angering my boss. He's got a mean streak and is a skilled assassin." His grin widens and he holds out

    his hand again.



        If game over: The bartender smiles and glances toward a massive man nearby that has a huge mace strapped to his belt. "I

    would advise against angering my boss. He's got a mean streak and is a skilled assassin." His grin widens and he holds out

    his hand again.

        You ignore his threat and push the tip of your sword into his throat, drawing a little blood. Suddenly you are yanked

    back and tossed onto a table behind you that breaks on impact. Before you can react, the mace is driven through your skull.

    You are killed on impact.



    If no:

        Part 2A-B

        You pull out your coin pouch and open it. How many coins would you like to give?

        If <= 5 The bartender gives you a disappointed look. "Sorry, still can't remember..."

        If > 5, <= 10 The bartender smiles. "Ya enter through the dragon's maw. There's a labyrinth from there. Be

    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's ya check."

        The charge was ten gold which you quickly pay before hurrying off.

        If > 10 The bartender smiles. "You enter through the dragon's maw. There's a labyrinth from there. Be

    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's your check."

    You look down at the paper in your hands, realizing you can't pay it. Regret fills your mind as the bartender leads

    you to the back to wash dishes. Because of your overspending you are stuck at the bar, working off your check and are

    unable to go on the expedition.



    Part 2B

    You reach back into your coin pouch to give the man more. How much do you want to give? Remember, you only have

coins_gave coins.

     coins_give = input "How many coins will you give? "

     coinGiver = 1

     while coinGiver == 1

        if coins_gave + coins_give <= 5

            The bartender gives you a disappointed look. "Sorry, still can't remember..."

        if coins_gave + coins_give > 5 and <=10

            The bartender smiles. "Ya enter through the dragon's maw. There's a labyrinth from there. Be

    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's ya check."

        The charge was ten gold which you quickly pay before hurrying off.

            coinGiver = 0

            entered_maze = 1

        if coins_gave + coins_give > 10

            The bartender smiles. "You enter through the dragon's maw. There's a labyrinth from there. Be

    careful of the zombies and manticores. I'm sure ya'd like to keep your brain and not be a statue. Now here's your check."

    You look down at the paper in your hands, realizing you can't pay it. Regret fills your mind as the bartender leads

    you to the back to wash dishes. Because of your overspending you are stuck at the bar, working off your check and are

    unable to go on the expedition.

            coingGiver = 0



    Section 3: Enter the Maze

    It takes you just about an hour to get to the ancient dragon bones. You find, just as the bartender said, a door inside

the beast's mouth. Cautiously you approach and find a something inscribed on the door.

    "Three colors here,

    do ye see.

    One per path,

    and paths be three,

    so which color,

    be for ye?"

    On the door there are three colored boxes that look like they can be pushed; one is purple, one is yellow, and one is

green. Which one would to try?



    Part 3A:

    If green

        start green path

        green_path = 1

    if purple

        start purple path

        purple_path = 1

    if red

        start red path

        red_path = 1



    Section 4: Green Path

    The door slowly opens revealing a long, winding hallway. Lining the walls are torches that burn with green flame. You

also notice that there are paintings of various dragons. In each one, the dragon is holding a green emerald. After roughly

ten minutes of walking the hallway comes to an end. There is a large painting of a green dragon, but there is a space where

his hands are. You notice on a desk before the painting are what appear to be various chunks of the painting. One has another

green emerald in the dragon's hands, one has a yellow citrine, and one has a purple amethyst.

    Which gem do you think you should put in the slot? (emerald, ruby, or amethyst)



    Part 4A

    if emerald

        The painting slowly swirls into a strange, wavy portal.

        go to Section 7

    if ruby

    The floor panel opens below you and you fall through a chute. The chute spits you into a lava pit where you join the

other lost souls of the labyrinth.

    if amethyst

    A spike shoots up from the floor impaling you, killing you instantly.



    Section 5: Purple Path

    The door slowly opens revealing a wide room. At the other end is another door that appears to be locked. You notice

there are wolves carved into the walls, and they are all holding an amethyst. Inscribed on the far door is riddle.

    "Only those who hold up purple can escape the wrath of the pack. Those who don't are sent all the way back."

    As you ponder the message you notice the wolves come off the walls. They seem focused at the center of the room. Before

your eyes, the center of the floor opens and an amethyst rises up on a pedestal. At that moment you realize what you are

supposed to do. You grab the amethyst off the pedestal and run to the door with it over your head. Two panels suddenly open

on the door, one in the middle of a carved sun, and one above a mountain.

    Where do you want to put the amethyst? (sun, or mountain)



    Part 5A

    if sun

    The wolves surround you and all at once pounce. You suddenly feel light and fuzzy as the room starts spinning. When

everything is still again, you find yourself at the main entrance again.

    Repeat Section3



    if mountain

    The wolves return to the walls and the door slowly slides open. Through the door is a strange portal.

    go to Section 7



    Section 6: Red Path

    The door opens revealing a short hallway lit by ominous red torches. At the other end is a door with what appears to

be a math equation. Beneath it is an inscription that reads, "solve me correctly and proceed. Solve incorrectly and don't

succeed."

    You examine the math problem and pull out a notebook and pencil. The equation asks you to find the solution of 6.45 +

10.95. Below the inscription are four buttons you can push with answers inscribed. They are 17.40, 17.41, 18.3, and 16.99.

Which button will you push?



    Part 6A

    if 17.40

    The door slides open revealing a strange portal behind it.

    go to Section 7



    else

    An spike shoots out of the wall, going straight through your skull. Unfortunately you join the lost souls of the labyrinth.



    Section 7: At Last, The Book

    Part 7A

    if player_race = dragonborn

    You enter the portal and find yourself in a room that looks like it was designed for evil worship. On the walls are paintings

of dragons, each one a different type. In the center of the room is a tome with a book on it. The title reads, "Book of

Vile Darkness," in gold lettering and below that is an image of Tiamat, the dragon's Goddess of evil, devouring a city. When you touch the

book it rises off the pedestal and opens to the first page. Calligraphic writing fades onto the page. "Hello, player_name,

how may I serve you?"



    if player_race = elf

    You enter the portal and find yourself in a room that looks like a holy elvin temple. Fantastic elvin tapestries line

the room, and the lighting is bright and natural. You feel almost at home here. In the center of the room, on an altar, sits

a book with the elven rune for death on the front of it. In black lettering below the rune is the title: "Book of Vile Darkness."

When you touch the book it rises into the air and opens itself to the first page. In gold calligraphic text it reads,

"Hello, player_name, how may I serve you?"



    If player_race = wolf

    You enter the portal and find yourself in a room that looks like a wolf clan's sacred cave. Ceremonial draperies hang

around the room, and on the far wall is a portrait of Xorthalax, the fierces wolf to ever have lived. Set upon a small

pillow in the center of the room is a book. At the top of the cover, in blood red text are the words, "Book of Vile Darkness."

Beneath that is the silhouette of a wolf's head eating a man. When you touch the book, it floats into the air and opens

to the first page. There is writing on the page in blood red calligraphy. It reads: "Hello, player_name, how may I serve you?"



    Part 7B

    If player_race = dragonborn or green_path = 1

    With an evil laugh you cast a spell from the book, destroying the labyrinth and carrying you high into the air. You

survey the landscape, deciding which town to destroy first.



    If player_race = dragonborn and green_path = 0

    You feel Tiamat's presence within the book, and you can feel her influence pushing into your mind. You quickly stick

the book in your satchel and leave the labyrinth to deliver your prize to The Archives, a place where cursed relics can be

safely stored and kept out of the wrong hands.



    else

    You close the book and place it in your satchel and leave the labyrinth to deliver the book to The Archives, a place

where cursed relics can be safely stored and kept out of the wrong hands.
